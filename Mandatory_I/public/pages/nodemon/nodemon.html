    databases, or user authentication. It is an easy and reliable way to add functionality to your 
    application. Some of the node modules we have you used in class are:

        This is a module we use to automatically restart our application when there are changes detected 
        in the source code. It helps developers speed up the process by automatically restarting the 
        server when you make changes. It is useful tool in the development stages of your application.
        Nodemon monitors the file system for any changes in the code and you can define it by writing 
        this in a nodemon.json file:
            </p>

                    {
                        "ext": "js, json, html"
                    }
                </code>
