        Node modules are packages we use as developers to access a large variety of functionality. 
    It can be from low-level working with files to a higher level library for building web application, 
    databases, or user authentication. It is an easy and reliable way to add functionality to your 
    application. Some of the node modules we have you used in class are:

        <h3 class="">Nodemon</h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
        This is a module we use to automatically restart our application when there are changes detected 
        in the source code. It helps developers speed up the process by automatically restarting the 
        server when you make changes. It is useful tool in the development stages of your application.
        Nodemon monitors the file system for any changes in the code and you can define it by writing 
        this in a nodemon.json file:

    <h3 class="">Express</h3>
    <p class="fs-5">
        Express is a popular framework, which is used to build webapplications in Node.js. Express gives a lot of valuable tools to make web servers and handling of HTTP requests and responses. 
        Some of the features we have had focus on are:        
    </p>
    <h5>Setup: </h5>
    <p>It is very easy to setup express. First you need to import it from the node modules, 
        instantiate it and then make it listen to a port. I have mine setup like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
        <code>
            import express from "express";
            const app = express();

            const PORT = 8080;
            app.listen(PORT, (error) =>{
            if(error){
            console.log(error);
            }
            console.log("Server is running on ", PORT);
        });
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h5 class="mt-5"> Routing: </h5>
    <p>Express provides a simple and flexible routing system that allows developers to map URLs to 
        specific functions or handlers.</p>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white mt-3">
            <code>
                app.get("/", (req, res) => {
                    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/frontpage/frontpage.html");
                });
            </code>
          </pre>
        <p class="mb-5">Here we use the functionality of sending the entire html file for the frontpage to the client, 
            when you route to "/"</p>
            <br>
        <h5> Templating: </h5>
        <p>We have constructed our own template engine to construct our pages that we serve with express. 
            In the templating engine we construct our pages before sending it to the client. Meaning we server side rendering it
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white mt-3">
            <code>
                function renderNodeModules(){
                    const path = "./public/pages/express/express.html";
                    const modulePage = readPage(path);
                    const constructedPage = renderPage(modulePage, {
                        tabTitle: "Node Modules"
                    });
                    return constructedPage;
                }
            </code>
          </pre>
        <p class="mb-5">
            This is a function to render the page you are reading now. 
            We get the path and use the readPage function to return the page as a string.
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white mt-3">
            <code>
                function readPage(pagePath){
                    return fs.readFileSync(pagePath).toString();
                }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="mb-5">Here we render the page with fs.readFileSync. We can use this because our 
            page only loads it in once on start. We convert it to a string and then returns it. 
            We go over to the renderPage function when this is done:</p>
            <br>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white mt-3">
            <code>
                function renderPage(page, config={}){
                    const navbar = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/navbar/navbar.html").toString()
                                    .replace("$TAB_TITLE", config.tabTitle || "Home")
                                    .replace("$CSS_LINK", config.cssLink || "");
                    const footer = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/footer/footer.html").toString()
                                    .replace("$FOOTER_YEAR", `Â© ${new Date().getFullYear()}`);
                
                    return navbar + page + footer;
                }
            </code>
          </pre>
        <p class="mb-5">
            In this code snippet we render the page with fs.readFileSync on our navbar and footer. 
            We can easily configure things on each webpage with our 
            variables declared with $VARIABLE_NAME.
            We got all the HTML converted to string and can easily construct the page. When we return it to our fist method
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white mt-3">
            <code>
                function renderNodeModules(){
                    const path = "./public/pages/express/express.html";
                    const modulePage = readPage(path);
                    const constructedPage = renderPage(modulePage, {
                        tabTitle: "Node Modules"
                    });
                    return constructedPage;
                }
            </code>
          </pre>
        <p>
            Here at last you can see we return the entirety of the constructedPage as a string,
            we can then route to this page via our app.js
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
            <code>
                const nodemodulesPage = templateEngine.renderNodeModules();

                app.get("/nodemodules", (req, res) =>{
                    res.send(nodemodulesPage);
                });
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h5 class="mt-5"> Static File Serving: </h5>
            <p>We serve our public as static to gain access to them 
                when we construct them and send them to the client.</p>
                <pre class="bg-dark text-white mt-3">
                    <code>
                        app.use(express.static("public"));
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Here we serve all the files static within the "public" folder. 
                This way we can seperate our work in static and dynamic files and optimize our application.
                This can optimize our application because it allows our server to handle them more effieciently</p>

    <h3 class="">NPM</h3>
    <p class="fs-5">
        To install these node modules and have access to vast library that Node.js contains, 
        we use a package manager called npm (Node package manager). 
        It makes it easy to install/uninstall different modules and even switch between different 
        versions:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>To install a module, you can search for a package on a website like this:
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">https://www.npmjs.com/</a>
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
            <code>
                npm i express
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>And the copy the CLI code and put it into the terminal on your project</p>
          <br>
          <p>You can also set up your dependencies in the package.json file, 
            which will install your project when CLI npm install</p>
            <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
                <code>
                    {
                        "dependencies": {
                          "autoprefixer": "^10.4.14",
                          "body-parser": "^1.20.2",
                          "express": "^4.18.2",
                          "nocache": "^3.0.4",
                          "nodemon": "^2.0.22",
                          "postcss-cli": "^10.1.0",
                          "sentiment": "^5.0.2"
                        },
                        "type": "module"
                      }
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>The same goes with uninstalling packages. You can just delete them from your package.json file and npm will remove it from your project.</p>
