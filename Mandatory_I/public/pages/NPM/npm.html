        Node modules are packages we use as developers to access a large variety of functionality. 
    It can be from low-level working with files to a higher level library for building web application, 
    databases, or user authentication. It is an easy and reliable way to add functionality to your 
    application. Some of the node modules we have you used in class are:

        To install these node modules and have access to vast library that Node.js contains, 
        we use a package manager called npm (Node package manager). 
        It makes it easy to install/uninstall different modules and even switch between different 
        versions:

        <br>
        <p>To install a module, you can search for a package on a website like this:
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">https://www.npmjs.com/</a>
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
            <code>
                npm i express
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>And the copy the CLI code and put it into the terminal on your project</p>
          <br>
          <p>You can also set up your dependencies in the package.json file, 
            which will install your project when CLI npm install</p>
            <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
                <code>
                    {
                        "dependencies": {
                          "autoprefixer": "^10.4.14",
                          "body-parser": "^1.20.2",
                          "express": "^4.18.2",
                          "nocache": "^3.0.4",
                          "nodemon": "^2.0.22",
                          "postcss-cli": "^10.1.0",
                          "sentiment": "^5.0.2"
                        },
                        "type": "module"
                      }
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>The same goes with uninstalling packages. You can just delete them from your package.json file and npm will remove it from your project.</p>
