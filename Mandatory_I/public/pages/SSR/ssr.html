<h1 class="text-center mt-3">Server-side Rendering - SSR</h1>
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-10">
        <p class="fs-4">Server-side rendering is way to render web pages on the server-side. 
    By sending fully-rendered HTML page to the client. A server-side rendered web page loads faster 
    and more easily discoverable by search engines.</p>
    <div>
        <h4>Benefits of SSR</h4>
        <p>1. Faster page loads: SSR can reduce the time it takes for a web page to load, 
            as the user is sent a fully rendered HTML page, rather than waiting for the JavaScript 
            to load and render the page on the client-side.</p>
        <p>
            2. Better performance on low-end devices: Devices with limited processing power or memory 
            can struggle with client-side rendering, but server-side rendering can provide a smoother 
            experience on these devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Search Engine Optimization: 
            Search engines can more easily index web pages that are fully rendered on the server-side, 
            leading to better search engine rankings and increased visibility.

        <h3>Client-side Rendering vs Server-side Rendering</h3>
        <p class="fs-5 my-3">Client-side rendering allows for highly interactive and dynamic web applications that can provide a 
            great user experience. It also allows for the creation of PWAs that can work offline and provide a 
            native-like experience on mobile devices. However, it can be less optimal for search engine 
            optimization (SEO) and initial page load times compared to server-side rendering.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 mt-3">This is an example of Client-side rendering</p>
            <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
                <code>
                    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
                        res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/frontpage/frontpage.html");
                    });
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p class="">Here we send the whole html file and only gives express 
                path to the file so it can send it to the client.
                The client then renders your file and it pops up in the browser.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="fs-5 mt-3">Compared to server side rendering which looks more like this:</p>
            <pre class="bg-dark text-white">
                <code>
                    const ssrPage = templateEngine.renderSSR();

                    app.get("/ssr", (req, res) =>{
                        res.send(ssrPage);
                    });
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>Here our page is rendered in a template engine we have built and 
                then send to the client as a string</p>
                <br>
                <h5>As you can see, with server side rendering, 
                    we do the rendering through a template engine in the backend</h5>
    </div>
